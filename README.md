Staff are frequently expected to complete a basic level of cyber-security awareness training which often stems from both a business need to comply with regulatory frameworks (ISO27001, NIST) and the ideal of reducing exploitable behaviours. Training is typically presented in an objective format which describes the risk, states expectations, and offers guidance on best practices. Despite the widespread adoption of such training, successful cyber-attacks continue to exploit the same behavioural vulnerabilities that these courses seek to manage. As such, the effectiveness of this training can be called into question.

Traditional descriptive training approaches emphasise objective knowledge transfer whilst failing to actively influence motivational factors which are essential for behavioural change. This study aims to examine whether narrative-based training interventions can better influence motivation to adopt secure behaviours. Using a 2x2 factorial design with control, this study will investigate how perspective-taking (attacker vs. defender narrative) and degree of interactivity (passive vs. interactive engagement) affect the self-reported security behaviour motivations among participants. Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory as a basis to conceptualise secure decision-making, this study aims to quantify these elements individual and combined effects on motivation, informing the development of more effective cyber-security training interventions.
