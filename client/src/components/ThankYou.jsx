<h1>Thank You for Taking Part</h1>

  <p>
    Thank you for completing the Perspectives and Participation study. Your contribution is greatly appreciated and will help us better understand how different types of training materials influence motivation to engage in secure behaviours at work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The study you took part in involved a short cyber-security intervention and follow-up questions designed to explore how people think and feel about cyber-security decisions. There were no right or wrong answers — we’re interested in your genuine views and experiences.

    Please remember that your data has now been anonymised and cannot be withdrawn. If you have any concerns about your participation or questions about the study, you're very welcome to get in touch with the lead researcher:
